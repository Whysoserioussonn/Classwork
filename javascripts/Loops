// The basics
// Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10,inclusive

for (let i=0;i<=10;i++)
{
    console.log(i)
}

// write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400
for (let i=10;i<=400;i++)
{
    console.log(i)
}
// write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 
// and going no higher than 4000
for (let i=12;i<=400;i+=3)
{
    console.log(i)
}

// B Get Even

// print out the numbers that are within the range of 1-100
for (let i=2;i<=100;i+=2)
{
    console.log(i)
}
// adjust your code to add a message next to even number only that say 
//"<- is an even number"
for (let i=2;i<=100;i+=2)
{
    console.log(i + ' <- is an even number')
}
